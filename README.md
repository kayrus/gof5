# gof5

## Requirements

* an application must be executed under a privileged user

## MacOS

On MacOS run the command below to avoid a `cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified` warning:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./path/to/gof5_darwin
```

## FreeBSD

On FreeBSD only `wireguard` or `ppp` (a wrapper around the ppp binary) drivers work. However the `wireguard` driver requires a [FreeBSD patch](freebsd.patch) applied before the compilation.

## Windows

Windows version requires `powershell.exe` and doesn't support `pppd` driver.
If gof5 cannot listen to 53 DNS port, try to comment out the `dns:` list in a config file.

## ChromeOS

Developer mode should be enabled, since gof5 requires root privileges.
The binary should be placed inside the `/usr/share/oem` directory. Home directory in ChromeOS doesn't allow to have executables.
`rewriteResolv: true` and `driver: pppd` config options should be set.

## HOWTO

```sh
# download the latest release
$ sudo gof5 --server server --username username --password token
```

Alternatively you can use a session ID, obtained during the web browser authentication (in case, when you have MFA). You can find the session ID by going to the VPN host in a web browser, logging in, and running this JavaScript in Developer Tools:

```js
document.cookie.match(/MRHSession=(.*?); /)[1]
```

Then specify it as an argument:

```sh
$ sudo gof5 --server server --session sessionID
```

When username and password are not provided, they will be asked if `~/.gof5/cookies.yaml` file doesn't contain previously saved HTTPS session cookies or when the saved session is expired or explicitly terminated (`--close-session`).

Use `--close-session` flag to terminate an HTTPS VPN session on exit. Next startup will require a valid username/password.

Use `--select` to choose a VPN server from the list, known to a current server.

## Configuration

You can define an extra `~/.gof5/config.yaml` file with contents:

```yaml
# DNS proxy listen address, defaults to 127.0.0.1
listenDNS: 127.0.0.1
# rewrite /etc/resolv.conf instead of renaming
# required in ChromeOS, where /etc/resolv.conf cannot be renamed
rewriteResolv: false
# TLS certificate check
insecureTLS: false
# Enable IPv6
ipv6: false
# driver specifies which tunnel driver to use.
# supported values are: wireguard, water or pppd.
# wireguard is default.
# pppd requires a pppd or ppp (in FreeBSD) binary
driver: wireguard
# When pppd driver is used, you can specify a list of extra pppd arguments
PPPdArgs: []
# disableDNS allows to completely disable DNS handling,
# i.e. don't alter the /etc/resolv.conf file at all
disableDNS: false
# a list of DNS zones to be resolved by VPN DNS servers
# when empty, every DNS query will be resolved by VPN DNS servers
dns:
- .corp.int.
- .corp.
# for reverse DNS lookup
- .in-addr.arpa.
# a list of primary DNS servers
# Primary DNS servers. When empty, will be parsed from /etc/resolv.conf
dnsServers:
- 8.8.8.8
- 8.8.4.4
# A list of subnets to be routed via VPN
# When not set, the routes pushed from F5 will be used
# Use "routes: []", if you don't want gof5 to manage routes at all
routes:
- 1.2.3.4
- 1.2.3.5/32
```
